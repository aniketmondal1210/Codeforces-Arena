# Evaluate Simple Expressions (a+b)

## Problem Statement
You are given an expression of the form `a+b`, where both `a` and `b` are **single-digit integers (0–9)**.  
Your task is to evaluate it and print the result.

---

## Input
- The first line contains an integer `t` — number of test cases.  
  (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)
- Each of the next `t` lines contains an expression of the form `a+b`  
  where `0 ≤ a, b ≤ 9`.

---

## Output
For each test case, print one integer — the result of the expression.
