# Bit++ Language Simulation

## Problem Statement
You are given a program written in the Bit++ language, which has only one variable `x` initialized to `0`.  
Each statement in the program either **increments** (`++`) or **decrements** (`--`) the value of `x`.

You need to execute all statements and print the final value of `x`.
